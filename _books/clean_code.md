**Clean Code** is a foundational software-engineering guide that teaches how to write readable, maintainable and efficient code. As I work through it this month, I’m learning principles and best practices for:

- Meaningful naming
- Small, focused functions
- Clear error handling
- Effective unit testing
- Refactoring legacy code

I’ll update this review with key takeaways and examples as I progress.
