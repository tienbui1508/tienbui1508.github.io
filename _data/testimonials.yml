    For many years I have been trying to increase my limited knowledge of IT and have struggled to master the technical aspects. Meeting Tien changed all that.
    Due to Tiens ability to explain things in a calm, clear way for the first time I now understand many things  that previously I hadn't been able to learn. His extensive knowledge was evident.
    Tiens friendly nature and patience created the optimum environment for learning.
    Tien was amazing and the best support I have ever had. I've gained a new enthusiasm due to my increasing knowledge and ability to use my laptop and iPhone more efficiently.
    Thank you Tien for your support and guidance. It has been brilliant and increased my skills beyond what I had hoped for.
