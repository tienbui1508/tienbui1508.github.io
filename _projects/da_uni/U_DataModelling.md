# Technical details

## Technologies and Tools used

| **Tech/Tool** | **Usage**                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| SQLite        | Database building          |
| SQL           | Database querying language |
| VS Code       | IDE                        |
| draw.io       | Diagram creating           |

## Tasks

- Construct the information model, including:
  - Entity Data Dictionary
  - Relationship Data Dictionary
  - Relationship-Entity Data Dictionary
  - Attributes Data Dictionary
- Draw up an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Construct the logical model
- Build a `SQL` database using `SQLite`
- Populate the database with sample data and execute queries to ensure that the schema was correctly implemented.

# Reflection

During the Data Modelling project, I had the opportunity to improve my skills in **data modelling** and `SQL`.
<br><br>
The schema design proved to be a challenging task, which required careful consideration of table relationships and data normalization to enhance efficiency. The use of `draw.io` aided me in identifying potential issues and refining the schema.
<br><br>
Working with `SQLite` was a new experience, but I found it to be a powerful and user-friendly tool for database creation and management. This project allowed me to practically apply my knowledge, and I gained valuable experience working with `SQLite`.
