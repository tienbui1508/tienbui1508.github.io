# Description

The Scuba Diving Calculation Assistant is a Java application designed to automate some simple and complex calculations that are common in the dive industry. It was created for a local dive shop owner who was tired of using a calculator to perform repetitive calculations. The application calculates the Partial Pressure of Oxygen (ppO2), Best Mix (BM), Maximum Operating Depth (MOD), and Equivalent Air Depth (EAD) for a requested input.

The underlying concepts and formulas used in scuba diving are provided in the application. Most of the time, divers breathe normal air, which comprises 21% Oxygen and 79% Nitrogen, which can be safely used to a depth of 68 metres. To avoid the risk of Central Nervous System (CNS) toxicity, the Partial Pressure of Oxygen (ppO2) in the mixture must be limited to a safe level of 1.1 ata to 1.6 ata inclusive.

The application uses a simple structure called the Circled T or T in the Circle to calculate the ppO2. In order to calculate the ppO2, we need to use another simple formula to convert depth in metres to ata. The application calculates the Maximum Operating Depth (MOD), Best Mix (BM), and Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PPO2) using these formulas. It also calculates the Equivalent Air Depth (EAD) to minimize Nitrogen Narcosis, which is calculated on mixtures of gas that contain more than the normal 21% of oxygen.

The prototype of the application is a text-based application that accepts user input and displays the requested calculation. The application ensures that all inputs are within the acceptable range and are suitable for the calculation selected. Errors are handled gracefully, and messages inform the user of the mistake and provide adequate opportunity to correct the error or perform another calculation.

In addition to the core algorithms, the application produces tables for Equivalent Air Depths and Partial Pressures. The application also calculates the SMOD, which is the most common partial pressure for the MOD calculation.

Overall, the Scuba Diving Calculation Assistant is an essential tool for divers to ensure that they stay safe while exploring the underwater world.
