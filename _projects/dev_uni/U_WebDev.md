# Overview

## Purpose

This project was a group (5 people) assignment for the Web-Based System Development subject. The main objective was to create a content management system for an e-commerce website that would allow authorized users to add, edit, and remove content from the site. Using web frameworks is not allowed.

## Functionality

- **User administration**: This function allowed an administrator user to manage users, including adding, editing, and deleting users. Users were assigned roles as either administrators or managers.
- **Category administration**: This function allowed a manager user to manage categories by adding, editing, and deleting them.
- **Product administration**: A manager user could also manage products by adding, editing, and deleting them.
- **Management reporting**: Both administrator and manager users could view dashboards and logs associated with their roles. An administrator user could view user logs, while a manager user could view user logs and product logs. These logs allowed users to see a history of changes made to the content management system.
